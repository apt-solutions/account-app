# General
This project is dependent on [bank-account-checker](https://github.com/tomreineke/bank-account-checker) in that it uses the generated transactions.ts file as an input for the [transactions.ts](https://github.com/tomreineke/account-app/blob/master/src/assets/transactions.ts) file in this project.

# Usage
After updating the transactions.ts file with the one created by [bank-account-checker](https://github.com/tomreineke/bank-account-checker) just start the Angular application as usual.

A browser window will open and on 
```
http://localhost:4200/ 
```
you should see the overview.
